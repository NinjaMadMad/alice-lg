## Explanations
Alice-LG is a BGP looking glass which gets its data from external APIs.

Currently Alice-LG supports the following APIs:
- [birdwatcher API](https://github.com/alice-lg/birdwatcher) for [BIRD](http://bird.network.cz/)

Normally you would first install the [birdwatcher API](https://github.com/alice-lg/birdwatcher) directly on the machine(s) where you run [BIRD](http://bird.network.cz/) on
and then install Alice-LG on a seperate public facing server and point her to the afore mentioned [birdwatcher API](https://github.com/alice-lg/birdwatcher).

This project was a direct result of the [RIPE IXP Tools Hackathon](https://atlas.ripe.net/hackathon/ixp-tools/)
just prior to [RIPE73](https://ripe73.ripe.net/) in Madrid, Spain.

Major thanks to Barry O'Donovan who built the original [INEX Bird's Eye](https://github.com/inex/birdseye) BIRD API of which Alice-LG is a spinnoff

## Building Alice-LG from scratch
__These examples include setting up your Go environment, if you already have set that up then you can obviously skip that__

In case you have trouble with `npm` and `gulp` you can try using `yarn`.

### CentOS 7:
First add the following lines at the end of your `~/.bash_profile`:
```bash
GOPATH=$HOME/go
export GOPATH
PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin
export PATH
```
Now run:
```bash
source ~/.bash_profile

# Install frontend build dependencies
sudo yum install golang npm
sudo npm install --global gulp-cli
sudo npm install --global yarn

go get github.com/GeertJohan/go.rice
go get github.com/GeertJohan/go.rice/rice
mkdir -p ~/go/bin ~/go/pkg ~/go/src/github.com/alice-lg/

cd ~/go/src/github.com/alice-lg
git clone https://github.com/alice-lg/alice-lg.git

cd alice-lg
make
```
Your Alice-LG source will now be located at `~/go/src/github.com/alice-lg/alice-lg` and your alice-LG executable should be at `~/go/src/github.com/alice-lg/alice-lg/bin/alice-lg-linux-amd64`

## Configuration

An example configuration can be found at
[etc/alice-lg/alice.example.conf](https://github.com/alice-lg/alice-lg/blob/readme_update/etc/alice-lg/alice.example.conf).

You can copy it to any of the following locations:

    etc/alice-lg/alice.conf        # local
    etc/alice-lg/alice.local.conf  # local
    /etc/alice-lg/alice.conf       # global


You will have to edit the configuration file as you need to point Alice-LG to the correct [APIs](https://github.com/alice-lg/birdwatcher):

```ini
[source.rs1-example-v4]
name = rs1.example.com (IPv4)
[source.rs1-example-v4.birdwatcher]
api = http://rs1.example.com:29184/
# show_last_reboot = true
# timezone = UTC
# type = single_table / multi_table
type = multi_table
# not needed for single_table
peer_table_prefix = T
pipe_protocol_prefix = M

[source.rs1-example-v6]
name = rs1.example.com (IPv6)
[source.rs1-example-v6.birdwatcher]
api = http://rs1.example.com:29186/
```

## Running

Launch the server by running

    ./bin/alice-lg-linux-amd64


## Deployment

We added a `Makefile` for packaging Alice as an RPM using [fpm](https://github.com/jordansissel/fpm).

If you have all tools available locally, you can just type:

    make rpm

If you want to build the package on a remote machine, just use

    make remote_rpm BUILD_SERVER=my-rpm-building-server.example.com

which will copy the dist to the remote server and executes fpm via ssh.

You can specify which system integration to use:
Set the `SYSTEM_INIT` variable to `upstart` or `systemd` (default)
prior to building the RPM.

    make remote_rpm BUILD_SERVER=rpmbuild.example.com SYSTEM_INIT=upstart


## Customization

Alice now supports custom themes!
In your alice.conf, you now can specify a theme by setting:

    [theme]
    path = /path/to/my/alice-theme

with the optional parameter (the "mountpoint" of the theme)
    url_base = /theme


You can put assets (images, fonts, javscript, css) in
this folder.

Stylesheets and Javascripts are automatically included in
the client's html and are served from the backend.

Alice provides early stages of an extension API, which is for now
only used to modify the content of the welcome screen,
by providing a javascript in your theme containing:

```javascript
Alice.updateContent({
    welcome: {
        title: "My Awesome Looking Glass",
        tagline: "powered by Alice"
    }
});

```

For an example check out: https://github.com/alice-lg/alice-theme-example

## Hacking

The client is a Single Page React Application.
All sources are available in `client/`.

Install build tools as needed:

    npm install -g gulp-cli


Create a fresh UI build with
```bash
cd client/
make client
```

This will install all dependencies and run `gulp`.

While working on the UI you might want to use `make watch`,
which will keep the `gulp watch` task up and running.

### Docker
For convenience we added a `Dockerfile` for building the frontend / client.

Create a fresh UI build using docker with
```bash
cd client/

# Dev build:
make -f Makefile.docker client

# Production build:
make -f Makefile.docker client_prod
```
You can use gulp with docker for watching the files while developing aswell:
```bash
make -f Makefile.docker watch
```
